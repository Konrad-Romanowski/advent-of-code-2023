# Advent of Code 2022

This repository consists of my solutions to Advent of Code 2022 daily code challanges:

All solutions were written on my own without checking any spoilers to the problems. Except small hints.

## Hints I used in my solutions

- _Day 8 part 2_ - Unfortunately, when got stuck with my code and I did a break, I went on [subbredit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/) and noticed spoilers about <code>LCM</code> solution. I must admit that without this hint, I probably wouldn't have been able to solve this problem on my own as my approach was more brute force like. Moreover, I used chat GPT to provide me with function that will calculate <code>LCM</code> from an array of numbers.

## Additionl comments

- Starting from day 10 of the challenge I no longer include my input for the puzzles. I was not aware that this was frowned upon.
